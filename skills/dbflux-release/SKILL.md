## When to Use

- Cutting a release branch from `main`
- Tagging a development prerelease (`-dev.N`) from `main`
- Tagging a release candidate (`-rc.N`) or stable version (`vX.Y.Z`) from a `release/vX.Y` branch
- Tagging a patch (`vX.Y.(Z+1)`) from a `release/vX.Y` branch
- Bumping versions in versioned artifacts (Cargo, Nix, Windows installer) and, on stable releases, the external AUR PKGBUILD
- Preparing changelog entries for any of the above

## Branching Model (read first — every action depends on this)

DBFlux uses **trunk + short-lived release branches**. There is exactly one long-lived branch (`main`); release branches live only as long as a minor line is supported.

| Branch                | Lifetime         | Accepts                                        | Tags produced                            |
|-----------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `main`                | permanent        | every new commit (features, fixes, refactors)  | `vX.Y.Z-dev.N`                           |
| `release/vX.Y`        | until EOL        | cherry-picked fixes only (no new features)     | `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`, `vX.Y.Z`, `vX.Y.(Z+1)`    |

**Inviolable rules:**

- A commit is never authored on a release branch. It always lands on `main` first and is then `git cherry-pick -x <sha>` into the release branch.
- A release branch is never merged back into `main`.
- No new features enter a release branch once cut. Only bugfixes and the version/changelog bumps that the release itself requires.
- `main` always carries the next minor's `-dev` version in its manifests (`vX.(Y+1).0-dev.N`). The release branch carries the version it is stabilizing.

## Tag → Source-Branch → GitHub Release Mapping

The release workflow already classifies tags (see `.github/workflows/release.yml` — `Classify release` step):

| Tag pattern          | Allowed source branch | GitHub release kind |
|----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| `vX.Y.Z-dev.N`       | `main`                | prerelease          |
| `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`        | `release/vX.Y`        | prerelease          |
| `vX.Y.Z`             | `release/vX.Y`        | stable (published)  |
| anything else        | (refuse)              | draft (safety net)  |

The skill MUST refuse to create a tag whose pattern does not match the current branch.

## Context Detection (always do this first)

Before any tagging or bumping action:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
git status --porcelain
git describe --tags --abbrev=0
git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -n 10
```

Resolve the context:

- Branch is `main` → "dev mode". Allowed: `-dev.N` tag, cut a new `release/vX.Y`.
- Branch matches `^release/v\d+\.\d+$` → "stabilization mode". Allowed: `-rc.N`, stable `vX.Y.Z`, patch bump.
- Any other branch → abort. Ask the user to switch to `main` or the appropriate release branch.

Working tree must be clean before any tag.

## Versioning Rules

Source-of-truth for the workspace version is `Cargo.toml` (`[workspace.package].version`). All other manifests must be kept in lockstep.

**On `main`:**
- The manifest version is always a `-dev.N` of the next minor (e.g. `0.7.0-dev.5`).
- Next dev bump: if last main tag is `vX.Y.Z-dev.N` → `vX.Y.Z-dev.(N+1)`. If the previous tag was stable → start at `vX.(Y+1).0-dev.0`.

**On `release/vX.Y`:**
- Next RC: if last tag on the branch is `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` → `-rc.(N+1)`. If none → `-rc.1`.
- Promote to stable: drop the `-rc.N` suffix → `vX.Y.0`.
- Patch: increment `Z` → `vX.Y.(Z+1)`. Never bump the minor on a release branch.

## Cut Procedure: `main` → `release/vX.Y`

When stabilization for a minor begins:

1. Verify you are on `main`, clean tree, up to date with `origin/main`.
2. Verify `.github/workflows/release.yml` on `main` contains the `Classify release` step (responsible for setting `draft`/`prerelease` from the tag pattern). If missing, fix on `main` first; otherwise the release branch will inherit a broken workflow and stable tags will publish as drafts. If a release branch already exists without this step, cherry-pick the fix into it before tagging.
3. Confirm the target minor `vX.Y` with the user.
4. Create the branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/vX.Y
   ```
5. On `release/vX.Y`:
   - In `CHANGELOG.md`, rename the `## [Unreleased]` section to `## [X.Y.0] - YYYY-MM-DD`.
   - Bump every versioned artifact to `X.Y.0-rc.1` (see "Files to Bump").
   - Commit: `chore(release): cut release/vX.Y at vX.Y.0-rc.1`.
   - Push: `git push -u origin release/vX.Y`.
6. Back on `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
   - Open a fresh `## [Unreleased]` block in `CHANGELOG.md`.
   - Bump every versioned artifact to `X.(Y+1).0-dev.0`.
   - Commit: `chore(version): begin X.(Y+1).0-dev cycle`.
   - Push.
7. Tag `vX.Y.0-rc.1` on the release branch (see "Tag Procedure").

## Tag Procedure (any tag)

1. Run local validation:
   ```bash
   cargo check --workspace
   cargo fmt --all -- --check
   cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
   cargo test --workspace
   ```
2. Confirm the versioned files match the tag exactly. The git tag is `vX.Y.Z[-suffix.N]`; the file versions drop the leading `v` but keep the suffix verbatim — except AUR `pkgver` (see "AUR Bump").
3. Create an annotated tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z[-suffix.N] -m "vX.Y.Z[-suffix.N]"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z[-suffix.N]
   ```
4. The GitHub Actions release workflow takes over (artifacts, classify, publish/prerelease).
5. Only after the workflow completes and the release is verified, do the post-release steps applicable to the tag kind (see "Post-Release Channels").

## Files to Bump

These must all carry the exact same version number per release (modulo the AUR translation below):

- `Cargo.toml` — `[workspace.package].version`. Workspace crates inherit via `version.workspace = true`.
- `flake.nix`
- `resources/windows/installer.iss`
- `CHANGELOG.md` — header for the version + entries.
- **Stable releases only:** `nix/release-info.nix` — see "Nix Bump".
- Review (does not inherit workspace version): `examples/custom_driver/Cargo.toml`.

## CHANGELOG Discipline

- A single `## [Unreleased]` block on `main`. Every commit that introduces user-visible behavior appends an entry to it.
- When `release/vX.Y` is cut, the `Unreleased` block on `main` is "split": the snapshot becomes `[X.Y.0]` on the release branch; `main` opens a new empty `Unreleased`.
- A cherry-pick into `release/vX.Y` should bring its changelog entry too. If the entry already exists in `main`'s new `Unreleased`, leave it; the duplication is intentional (one entry per shipped tag).
- The release workflow extracts the section by header (`## [X.Y.Z]`) — keep that format exactly.

## Cherry-Pick Discipline

A release branch should never contain commits that don't exist on `main`, except the release-only commits (`chore(release): ...`, `chore(version): ...`).

```bash
# On main: land the fix.
git checkout main
# ...commit, push...

# On release branch: cherry-pick with -x to record the source SHA.
git checkout release/vX.Y
git cherry-pick -x <sha>
```

Sanity check: every non-release commit on `release/vX.Y` since branch-off should mention `(cherry picked from commit ...)` in its message.

### CHANGELOG sync on cherry-pick (MANDATORY)

When a cherry-picked commit carries a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, the cherry-pick is incomplete until you also sync main's CHANGELOG in **two** complementary ways. Rationale: leaving the entry in `[Unreleased]` causes main's changelog to drift into a duplicate of what already shipped (the v0.5.0 → v0.5.1 bug); but only deleting it leaves main with no record of the patch existing, so the v0.5.2..v0.5.5 sections never appear in main's history (the v0.5.5 bug). Both moves are needed.

The invariant after a stable patch `vX.Y.Z` ships:

1. No item present in the release branch's `[X.Y.Z]` section remains in main's `[Unreleased]`.
2. Main's `CHANGELOG.md` contains a `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section, byte-identical to the one on the release branch, inserted in semver-descending order.

Procedure when tagging `vX.Y.Z` on a release branch (run after the tag is pushed):

```bash
# A) On the release branch — already done as part of the release commit:
#    CHANGELOG.md has the [X.Y.Z] section with bullets describing the patch.

# B) Sync main.
git checkout main
git pull
```

Then edit `CHANGELOG.md` on main to do BOTH:

- **Remove** every bullet from `[Unreleased]` that is now covered by `[X.Y.Z]`.
- **Insert** the full `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section (copy verbatim from the release branch) into main, in semver-descending order. For a `0.5.Z` patch shipped while main carries `0.6.0-dev.N`, the section goes **between** `[0.6.0-dev.N]` and the next-highest existing `[0.5.*]` entry.

Commit and push:

```bash
git commit -am "chore(changelog): sync v$X.Y.Z to main"
git push
```

Helper to copy the section verbatim from the release branch (avoid hand-retyping bullets):

```bash
git show release/vX.Y:CHANGELOG.md \
  | sed -n "/^## \[X.Y.Z\]/,/^## \[/p" \
  | sed '$d'
```

If a release ships multiple cherry-picked entries, batch both moves into a single commit on `main` once the release branch is tagged.

**Audit after each stable patch:**

- `git diff main release/vX.Y -- CHANGELOG.md` shows no differences in the `[X.Y.Z]` section (modulo surrounding context).
- `grep '^## \[' CHANGELOG.md` on main is monotonically descending in semver and includes every shipped `X.Y.Z`.
- The bullets under `[X.Y.Z]` on the release branch do not appear under `[Unreleased]` on main.

Common failure mode to refuse: a release that adds the section to the release branch only and never propagates back to main. The skill MUST perform step B before considering the release complete.

## Nix Bump

The flake exposes a prebuilt-binary package (`dbflux-bin`, default) backed by `nix/release-info.nix`, which pins each system to a GitHub Release tarball. Refresh it **only on stable** tags; skip for `-dev.N` and `-rc.N`.

Steps (run from the dbflux repo after the GitHub Release is published):

```bash
ver=X.Y.Z
for arch in amd64 arm64; do
  curl -fsSL -o /tmp/dbflux-$arch.tar.gz \
    "https://github.com/0xErwin1/dbflux/releases/download/v$ver/dbflux-linux-$arch.tar.gz"
  nix-hash --to-sri --type sha256 \
    "$(sha256sum /tmp/dbflux-$arch.tar.gz | cut -d' ' -f1)"
done
```

Update `nix/release-info.nix`:
- `version` → `X.Y.Z`
- Both `url` lines → `…/v$ver/…`
- Both `hash` lines → the corresponding SRI hash printed above.

Verify locally before committing:

```bash
nix build .#dbflux-bin --no-link --print-out-paths
```

If the build fails with a hash mismatch, the artifact in GitHub was likely re-uploaded; redo the prefetch. The release must be **published** (not draft) before the prebuilt path is fetchable.

## AUR Bump

AUR is bumped manually today, in an **external AUR repository** (not this repo — no `PKGBUILD` lives here). Until automation lands, only **stable** tags (`vX.Y.Z` without suffix) are published to AUR. Skip AUR for `-dev.N` and `-rc.N`.

**Important constraint:** AUR `pkgver` does **not** allow `-` (hyphen is reserved for `pkgrel`). For stable releases the translation is a no-op (`pkgver=X.Y.Z`). If a prerelease ever needs to be published on AUR in the future:

- `vX.Y.Z-dev.N` → `pkgver=X.Y.Z.dev.N` (dots only).
- `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` → `pkgver=X.Y.Z.rc.N`.

Steps for a stable AUR bump (run in the AUR repo clone, not in dbflux):

1. Update `PKGBUILD`:
   - `pkgver=X.Y.Z`
   - Reset `pkgrel=1`
2. Regenerate `.SRCINFO`:
   ```bash
   makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO
   ```
3. Validate locally:
   ```bash
   namcap PKGBUILD
   makepkg -si --noconfirm   # optional, on Arch only
   ```
4. Commit + push to the AUR remote:
   ```bash
   git commit -am "release: vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin master
   ```
5. Future hardening: replace `sha256sums_*=('SKIP')` with real hashes computed from the published GitHub artifacts.

## nixpkgs Bump (future, not active yet)

When DBFlux lands in `NixOS/nixpkgs`:

- Only stable tags get bumped there.
- The flow is a PR to `NixOS/nixpkgs` updating `pkgs/by-name/db/dbflux/package.nix` (or wherever it lives at the time):
  - `version = "X.Y.Z";`
  - `src.hash = "sha256-..."` (recompute via `nix-prefetch-github` or `nix-prefetch-url`).
  - `cargoHash = "sha256-..."` if it uses `buildRustPackage`.
- Open the PR with title `dbflux: X.Y.(Z-1) -> X.Y.Z` per nixpkgs convention.

Mark this as TODO in the skill until the package is upstreamed; do not invent the path before then.

## Post-Release Channels (what to do after the GitHub release publishes)

| Tag kind          | GitHub Release | Main CHANGELOG sync       | AUR              | Nix flake (this repo) | nixpkgs (future)  |
|-------------------|----------------|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| `-dev.N` (main)   | prerelease     | n/a (tag is on main)      | skip             | skip                  | skip              |
| `-rc.N` (release) | prerelease     | skip                      | skip             | skip                  | skip              |
| Stable `vX.Y.Z`   | published      | **mandatory** (see below) | bump + push      | bump `release-info`   | bump + PR         |

For stable `vX.Y.Z` from a release branch, "Main CHANGELOG sync" means both removing the now-released bullets from main's `[Unreleased]` AND inserting the `[X.Y.Z]` section into main in semver-descending order — see "CHANGELOG sync on cherry-pick (MANDATORY)" above. Skipping this step is a failure mode that has shipped twice; do not complete a stable release without it.

## Anti-Patterns (explicit refusals)

Refuse, with a clear message, if any of these are requested:

- Tagging `vX.Y.Z` or `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` while HEAD is on `main`.
- Tagging `vX.Y.Z-dev.N` while HEAD is on a `release/*` branch.
- Merging `release/vX.Y` back into `main`.
- Creating new features (non-fix commits) on a `release/*` branch.
- Bumping minor or major version inside a `release/*` branch.
- Pushing a tag without the working tree being clean.
- Pushing the AUR bump with `pkgver` containing a hyphen.
- Cherry-picking a commit with a `CHANGELOG.md` entry into a release branch **without** also (a) removing that entry from main's `[Unreleased]` block AND (b) inserting the corresponding `[X.Y.Z]` section into main once `vX.Y.Z` is tagged. Both moves are required; doing only one is the recurring bug this skill exists to prevent.
- Cutting a `release/vX.Y` branch from a `main` HEAD where `.github/workflows/release.yml` is missing the `Classify release` step (any stable tag on that branch will publish as draft).
