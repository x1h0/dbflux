# Changelog

All notable changes to DBFlux will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.6] – 2026-02-28

### Added

* Comprehensive live integration tests for all five database drivers (43 tests covering schema introspection, CRUD, browse/count, explain, describe, cancellation, code generators, document CRUD, and KeyValueApi)
* Docker-based test infrastructure for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis with automatic container lifecycle management
* Driver contract validation tests for metadata, form definitions, and capability declarations

### Changed

* AppState now accepts an external driver registry, making driver wiring controllable across different runtime contexts
* Document open and query connection selection extracted into explicit decision paths for consistent handling of missing connections and per-database routing
* MySQL `information_schema` queries migrated from `format!()` string interpolation to parameterized queries (`conn.exec` with `?` placeholders)
* MySQL nullable column reads (`Option<String>`) now use `row.get_opt()` to correctly distinguish SQL NULL from missing columns

### Fixed

* MySQL schema introspection panic on MySQL 8.4 where `column_key` in `information_schema.columns` can be NULL
* MySQL constraint introspection panic where `GROUP_CONCAT` over a `LEFT JOIN` returns NULL for CHECK constraints without key columns
* Windows portable builds no longer open a CMD console window when launched outside a terminal
* CI integration test job now installs required system dependencies (`libdbus-1-dev`, `libxkbcommon-dev`)

---

## [0.3.5] – 2026-02-26

### Added

* Explicit unsupported-value representation in query results (`UNSUPPORTED<type>`) to distinguish decode gaps from real `NULL` values

### Changed

* Unsupported values are now treated as read-only in the data grid and are excluded from save/copy mutation flows

### Fixed

* Added complete PostgreSQL `tsvector`/`tsquery` handling across table browse, query results, and grid filtering
* PostgreSQL fallback decode paths no longer misrepresent unknown types as `NULL`, reducing confusion and avoiding incorrect edits

---

## [0.3.4] – 2026-02-26

### Added

* Inline enum/set dropdown editing in the data grid with keyboard navigation (`j/k`, arrows, `Enter`, `Esc`)
* Nullable enum editing support with explicit `NULL` option in dropdowns
* Driver-level enum value metadata (`enum_values`) in `ColumnInfo` for PostgreSQL and MySQL
* Info-level logging for unsupported value decoding paths in PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite drivers

### Changed

* PostgreSQL column introspection now uses `pg_catalog` + `format_type(...)` to preserve real type names (including user-defined types)
* PostgreSQL generated SQL literals now use escaped single-quoted string literals for readability
* MySQL `ENUM(...)` and `SET(...)` column definitions are parsed and exposed as selectable values in the UI

### Fixed

* PostgreSQL custom types (enum/domain/composite/range) no longer appear as `NULL` due to restrictive string decoding
* Table mode command routing now handles `Execute`/`Cancel` correctly, restoring keyboard-driven inline editing flow
* `LIKE` filter generation now only adds `ESCAPE '\\'` when required by the search value
* PostgreSQL `uuid` columns now cast to `::text` for `LIKE` filters

---

## [0.3.3] – 2026-02-26

### Added

* File-backed "New Tab" flow and keyboard navigation in the context bar
* Settings toggle to mask and reveal SSH password fields
* MongoDB sidebar metadata with collection-level indexes and a database-level indexes folder
* MongoDB field schema sampling in the sidebar (field type, optionality, nested fields)

### Changed

* Sidebar schema folders now stay visible with zero counts while lazy details load
* SQL and MongoDB schema folders are collapsed by default to avoid layout jumps during refresh

### Fixed

* Sidebar expansion no longer gets stuck in a loading state when opening schema nodes
* Closing a database connection no longer blocks the UI thread and freezes the app

---

## [0.3.2] – 2026-02-24

### Added

* Filter submenu in data grid context menu for SQL databases (=, <>, >, <, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL, Remove filter)
* Order submenu in data grid context menu for SQL databases (ASC, DESC, Remove order)
* MongoDB filter submenu in document tree context menu with Extended JSON values, `$and` composition, and NULL semantics (`$exists` guard)
* ListFilter and ArrowUpDown icons
* Empty state for the sidebar connections tab ("No connections yet" hint)

### Changed

* CI release workflow extracts changelog section from CHANGELOG.md instead of using hardcoded text

### Fixed

* GPUI newline panic: escape control characters in `Value::Json` preview in document tree
* GPUI newline panic: escape control characters in `Value::Text` and catch-all rendering in document card view
* GPUI newline panic: use compact JSON (no newlines) when composing MongoDB filters for the single-line filter input
* Toolbar clear-filter button now re-runs the query after clearing (was only calling `cx.notify()` without `refresh()`)
* Refactored icon asset loading to use `ALL_ICONS` lookup table instead of match arms

---

## [0.3.1] – 2026-02-24

### Fixed

* Table expansion in sidebar now loads and displays columns, indexes, and foreign keys instead of showing a stuck "Loading..." placeholder
* Concurrent table expansions no longer overwrite each other (replaced single pending action slot with per-item map)
* Failed schema fetches now collapse the table node instead of leaving it stuck in loading state
* Cache key mismatch between tree builder and fetch path that prevented details from ever appearing for per-database connections

### Added

* Collapsed sidebar now shows separate buttons for Connections and Scripts tabs
* FileCode icon registered in asset source

---
