# Changelog

All notable changes to DBFlux will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.0-dev.14] – 2026-04-03

### Changed

* Architecture refactor: split codebase into `dbflux_app` (pure domain, no GPUI dependency) and `dbflux_ui` (all GPUI/UI code)
* `dbflux` binary is now a thin shell that only bootstraps the application and IPC server
* Keymap domain types moved from `dbflux_ui` to `dbflux_app`
* `AppState` extracted as a plain struct in `dbflux_app`; `AppStateEntity` wrapper with GPUI event emission lives in `dbflux_ui`

### Fixed

* Fixed clippy warnings: renamed `keymap/keymap.rs` to `keymap_layer.rs`, fixed `ToastHost` Default impl, removed unnecessary `WindowHandle` clones
* Audit viewer: moved status bar outside flex_1 to fix render layout
* Updated crate references throughout codebase following the app/UI split

## [0.4.0-dev.13] – 2026-04-02

### Added

* Audit architecture centralization: all audit events now flow through `AuditService::record()` with typed `AuditAction` constants (`MCP_AUTHORIZE`, `QUERY_EXECUTE`, `CONNECTION_CONNECT`, `HOOK_EXECUTE`, `CONFIG_CHANGE`, `SYSTEM_STARTUP`, etc.)
* `EventOrigin` and `AuditContext` helpers for consistent actor/source mapping across MCP, UI, and system event origins
* Global panic hook with chained best-effort panic recording via `record_panic_best_effort()`
* MCP governance audit integration: authorization events with `correlation_id`, atomic `audit_execution()` policy-first audit, typed execution actions
* Query/script boundary audit: typed events with `duration_ms`, `details_json` on cancel, dangerous query confirmation
* Connection lifecycle and hook execution audit: typed events via `record()`
* System lifecycle audit: `system_startup`, `system_shutdown`, `system_panic` events
* Audit viewer UI redesign: CloudWatch-like inline expansion, shared chrome components, `RefreshPolicy` dropdown

### Changed

* Removed legacy `AuditService::append()` from public API; `record()` is now the only canonical path
* Unified audit event validation with category-specific field requirements and `details_json` normalization before fingerprinting/redaction

## [0.4.0-dev.12] – 2026-03-31

### Added

* Unified SQLite storage: consolidated all state into a single `~/.local/share/dbflux/dbflux.db` with domain-prefixed tables (`cfg_*`, `st_*`, `aud_*`, `sys_*`) and proper foreign key constraints across previously isolated domains
* SQLite-backed connection tree: migrated the connection tree from JSON file storage to native SQLite with a `TreeStore` trait abstraction
* Flat-column schema migration: rewrote all repositories to replace JSON blob columns with dedicated flat tables for drivers, proxies, SSH tunnels, hooks, sessions, and governance policies
* Internal SQLite bootstrap: the storage crate now bootstraps its own runtime, removing dependency on app-managed SQLite handles for internal state
* Session and runtime state persistence: session metadata, runtime state, and durable config now persist directly to the state and config databases
* Import diagnostics and reset tools: added tooling for diagnosing and resetting legacy JSON import state

## [0.4.0-dev.11] – 2026-03-27

### Added

* MCP governance foundation crates for policy evaluation, approval queues, and SQLite-backed audit logging
* Standalone MCP server runtime, CLI integration, canonical tool catalog, and in-app governance/settings surfaces
* Rich typed driver metadata and capability models, plus semantic planning and driver-owned query generation across the supported databases

### Changed

* Query execution and SQL/query previews now route through driver planning abstractions instead of raw, UI-owned generation paths
* Connection and access plumbing now expose the metadata and governance hooks needed to keep MCP behavior aligned with app-managed connections
* Connection Manager and Settings gained MCP-specific controls and reusable multi-select UI for governance configuration

### Fixed

* MCP tool safety rules were hardened so unsupported operations are rejected explicitly and preview flows stay read-only
* PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, MySQL, Redis, and DynamoDB driver paths received follow-up fixes for connection stability, schema inspection, filter translation, pagination, and aggregate handling
* Test isolation and governance/runtime coverage were expanded to catch regressions in the new MCP flow before release

## [0.4.0-dev.9] – 2026-03-17

### Fixed

* X11 window management issues: windows now render correctly on all X11 compositors with proper min size hints for tiling WM support
* Connection Manager keyboard navigation now includes auth profile and inline value source rows in the focus flow
* Settings forms now use unified `FormSection` trait for consistent two-level focus model across all sections (Auth Profiles, Hooks, Drivers, Proxies, SSH Tunnels, Services)
* Sidebar multi-select drag/drop and keyboard nesting stabilized with proper edge case handling
* Nix build configuration updated for proper derivation structure

---

## [0.4.0-dev.8] – 2026-03-12

### Added

* Built-in DynamoDB driver with end-to-end app integration, including schema browse and mutation/query support
* In-app AWS SSO login flow and auth profile wizard, integrated across workspace overlays, Connection Manager, and Settings
* Provider-agnostic dynamic value source flow for managed access fields (SSM, Secrets Manager, and Parameter Store references)
* Language-specific script icons in the sidebar for Lua, Python, Bash, JavaScript, and InfluxDB files

### Changed

* Auth and managed access orchestration is now provider-driven via a runtime auth provider registry and generic pipeline stages
* Saving SSO/shared AWS auth profiles now writes compatible `[profile ...]` entries to `~/.aws/config` with idempotent updates
* Nix development builds now statically link OpenSSL for better portability outside Nix environments
* Driver crates now include dedicated README files documenting current features and limitations

### Fixed

* DynamoDB filter expression generation no longer emits redundant logical wrapping that could trigger `ValidationException` errors

---

## [0.4.0-dev.7] – 2026-03-07

### Added

* Native file browser button on the SQLite connection form so users can pick a database file instead of typing the full path
* Per-process authentication tokens for app-control IPC and driver RPC host handshakes, preventing unauthorized local process access

### Changed

* Credentials now use `SecretString` end-to-end across core, drivers, IPC handoff, and UI; plain strings are only exposed at explicit boundaries (keyring write, driver connect)
* `SecretStore::set()` accepts `&SecretString` instead of `&str`, pushing `expose_secret()` to the keyring boundary
* Detached async tasks that silently discarded `cx.update()` failures now log warnings through an `AsyncUpdateResultExt` trait (38 call sites across 9 files)

### Fixed

* SSH tunnels now enforce host key TOFU verification instead of accepting any host key
* Proxy tunnels enforce TLS when the target uses HTTPS, and `unreachable!` branches in proxy transport are replaced with safe fallbacks
* PostgreSQL URI `sslmode` parameter is now honored during connection
* URI passwords are sanitized before profile persistence to prevent accidental credential storage in plaintext config
* Lua VM memory is capped at 16 MiB to prevent runaway scripts from exhausting host memory
* Script rename validation rejects path traversal sequences
* IPC mutex operations replaced with explicit error handling instead of panic-prone `unwrap()`
* Proxy credentials are redacted in debug output

* Code documents can run Bash, Python, and Lua files directly, with live output streaming while scripts execute
* New `dbflux_lua` crate provides sandboxed in-process Lua execution for hooks and editor-run scripts
* Dedicated style CI workflow now runs `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`

### Changed

* The old SQL query document evolved into a language-aware code document with script-specific execution UI and shared live-output plumbing for hooks and manual runs
* Release workflow now waits for both test and style jobs before building artifacts
* New connections and SSH tunnels now save credentials to the system keyring by default unless explicitly disabled

### Fixed

* Detached pre-connect hooks now wait for an explicit ready signal and a reachable TCP endpoint before opening the database connection
* Hook-owned tunnel processes are cleaned up when startup fails or is cancelled, and MySQL `localhost` tunnel connections now consistently use IPv4
* Query context selectors now refresh when connection state changes, and per-database query cancellation targets the correct connection so databases can be reopened cleanly
* Typing `z` in the editor works again instead of toggling panels while text input is focused
* PostgreSQL retry setup and live integration tests now compile cleanly under current type inference requirements
* Restored the full `LICENSE-MIT` text in release artifacts

---

## [0.4.0-dev.5] – 2026-03-05

### Added

* Tab context menu: right-click or Ctrl+M on workspace tabs to Close, Close Others, Close All, Close to the Left, Close to the Right; supports j/k and arrow key navigation
* Sidebar: new folders auto-select, scroll into view, and enter rename mode immediately after creation
* Sidebar: "Duplicate" option in connection profile context menu clones the profile including keyring passwords into the same folder
* Shared `context_menu` component used by both sidebar and tab bar menus, replacing the old sidebar-specific implementation

### Changed

* `dbflux_core` reorganized from 50 flat files into 10 thematic subdirectories: `core/`, `driver/`, `schema/`, `sql/`, `query/`, `connection/`, `storage/`, `data/`, `config/`, `facade/`; all public re-exports preserved for backward compatibility
* UI layer reorganized: workspace, sidebar, status bar, and tasks panel moved into `views/`; modals into `overlays/`; toast and dropdown into `components/`
* `key_value.rs` (4601 lines) split into 9 focused submodules; `settings.rs` split into lifecycle/dirty_state/sidebar_nav; `connection_manager/render.rs` split into per-section files
* Documentation updated (ARCHITECTURE.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, CODE_STYLE.md) to reflect new directory structure and `mod.rs` convention

---

## [0.4.0-dev.4] – 2026-03-04

### Added

* Proxy tunnel support: SOCKS5 and HTTP CONNECT proxy profiles with full CRUD in Settings, per-connection proxy selection in Connection Manager, and automatic tunnel lifecycle (RAII)
* New `dbflux_tunnel_core` crate extracting shared RAII tunnel lifecycle, `TunnelConnector` trait, `ForwardingConnection<R>` bidirectional forwarder, and adaptive sleep strategy
* Proxy profiles stored in `~/.config/dbflux/proxies.json` with keyring-backed secret storage for Basic auth passwords
* `no_proxy` pattern matching (curl/wget `NO_PROXY` semantics: wildcard, exact, suffix with/without leading dot)

* `HasSecretRef` trait unifies secret operations across SSH tunnel and proxy profiles
* `FormGridNav<F>` generic extracts shared 2D grid navigation from proxy and SSH tunnel settings forms
* SSH tunnel forwarding loop now uses `ForwardingConnection<ssh2::Channel>` from `dbflux_tunnel_core` and gains adaptive sleep (50ms idle / 1ms active)
* SSH tunnel read-only mode in Connection Manager now shows saved tunnel details with "Edit in Settings" button
* Connection Manager tab order changed to Main → Settings → SSH → Proxy

### Fixed

* HTTP CONNECT proxy `BufReader` could silently consume post-handshake bytes; replaced with byte-by-byte `read_http_line()`
* Proxy tunnel handle is now preserved across database switches so the tunnel stays alive for the connection lifetime

---

## [0.4.0-dev.3] – 2026-03-03

### Added

* Connection hooks system: define reusable command hooks in Settings and bind them to connection profiles for execution during connect/disconnect phases (PreConnect, PostConnect, PreDisconnect, PostDisconnect)
* Each hook runs as an external process with command/args, optional cwd, custom env vars, timeout, and cancellation support
* Per-hook failure policy: Disconnect (abort flow), Warn (continue with warning), Ignore (log only)

* Settings sidebar moved from a flat list to a tree with collapsible Network/Connection groups, persistent collapse state, and gutter connector lines
* Tree gutter rendering is now shared between Settings and Sidebar for consistent connector visuals and row sizing

### Fixed

* Sidebar profile/database chevron interactions now behave correctly: connected profiles expand/collapse, disconnected profiles connect on first click, and active profile changes stay in sync with tree state

---

## [0.4.0-dev.2] – 2026-03-01

### Added

* Settings now includes General, Services, and Drivers sections, with schema-backed per-driver override controls
* New Services settings section for configuring external RPC driver services
* Connection Manager now includes a Settings tab for per-connection overrides of global/driver policies and driver-owned settings

### Changed
