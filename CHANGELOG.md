# Changelog

All notable changes to DBFlux will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.0] – 2026-02-23

### Added

#### MongoDB Support

* MongoDB driver with collection browsing, CRUD operations, and schema introspection
* Document tree view with keyboard navigation, search, and value expansion
* MongoDB query parsing and validation with positional diagnostics
* MongoDB shell query generator for "Copy as Query" support
* Document view context menu with language-aware editor

#### Redis Support

* Redis driver with key-value API integration
* Key-value document browser with keyboard-navigable new-key modal
* Support for all Redis data types: String, Hash, Set, Sorted Set, List, Stream
* Context menu and real pagination for the key browser
* Live TTL countdown display
* Add Member modal for collection types
* Redis key completions and command arity validation in the editor

#### Script Documents

* File-backed query documents with Open (`Ctrl+O`), Save (`Ctrl+S`), and Save As (`Ctrl+Shift+S`)
* Execution context bar with connection, database, and schema dropdowns per tab
* Scripts folder in the sidebar with file and folder management

#### Session Persistence

* Auto-save on a 2-second debounce after each keystroke
* Scratch files for untitled tabs, shadow files for file-backed tabs (explicit `Ctrl+S` still writes the original)
* Full session restore on startup from `~/.local/share/dbflux/sessions/`
* Conflict detection: warns when original file was modified externally while a shadow existed
* Tabs close without unsaved-changes warnings

#### Per-Database Connections

* PostgreSQL supports multiple databases open simultaneously in the sidebar
* Query tabs target a specific database connection instead of sharing a single switchable one

#### Document System

* Tab-based document architecture with `DocumentHandle` and `TabManager`
* SQL query documents with multiple result tabs (MRU ordering)
* Collapsible, resizable sidebar dock and bottom dock panels
* History modal integrated with document-based focus system

#### Editor Enhancements

* Language-aware autocompletion (SQL tables/columns, MongoDB collections, Redis keys)
* Live query diagnostics with positional error markers
* Redis command arity validation in the editor

#### Data Grid

* Inline cell editing with focus handling
* Modal editor for JSON and long text values (`CellEditorModal`)
* Context menu with CRUD operations and SQL generation
* Keyboard navigation in context menus
* Column resizing via drag
* Support for empty tables in the data grid
* Row insert and duplicate without requiring a primary key

#### Query Generation

* Unified query generation with "Copy as Query" and preview modal
* `QueryGenerator` trait implemented by PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, and Redis drivers
* `SqlDialect` trait for SQL flavor differences across drivers

#### Export

* Multi-format export: CSV, JSON, Text, and Binary
* Export generalized by result shape instead of hardcoded CSV

#### Auto-Refresh

* Interval-based auto-refresh with unified refresh split button
* `DocumentTaskRunner` for unified async task tracking

#### Connection Manager

* URI connection mode for PostgreSQL and MySQL
* Bidirectional sync between connection URI and individual form fields

#### Query Safety

* Dangerous query detection for SQL, MongoDB, and Redis commands
* Confirmation dialog with query preview before destructive operations

#### Sidebar

* Schema-level indexes, foreign keys, and data types in the tree
* Schema-level metadata support for MySQL and SQLite
* Context menus for indexes, foreign keys, and custom types
* `q`/`e` keys to switch between Connections and Scripts tabs
* Inline rename in the tree (both tabs)
* Default focus to sidebar on startup when no tabs are open

#### Packaging & CI

* macOS release builds with `.app` bundle (`Info.plist`)
* Windows release builds with Inno Setup installer
* MongoDB and Redis feature flags enabled in default builds

### Changed

* `CellValue` pre-computes display text at construction time (avoids allocation during render)
* Lazy loading for PostgreSQL and SQLite drivers (shallow metadata first, details on demand)
* Sidebar uses `SchemaNodeId` parsing instead of stale underscore prefixes
* Custom toast implementation replaces `gpui-component` toast
* AppState decomposed into focused sub-managers in `dbflux_core`
* Architecture decoupled: core traits, driver capabilities, and error formatting extracted
* Oversized UI modules split into focused submodules (sidebar, SQL query, modals, SSH form)
* Active context detection improved in data grids
* Document focus restored correctly across menus and modals
* Scripts tab styling matches connections tab (icon and label colors)
* Removed force-close flow (double `Ctrl+W` warning, pending force close state)

### Performance

* Fixed catastrophic 1 FPS rendering issue in the data table
* Row-level event handlers replace per-cell closures in tables
* Background executor used consistently for all database operations

### Fixed

* Document focus restored across menus and modals
* Redis database state handling and UI interaction bugs
* SSH tunnel form mouse focus syncs with keyboard state
* Settings sync between SSH form fields
* Panics and unwraps eliminated across UI and driver code
* Empty query results now return column metadata correctly
* DDL queries show preview modal and editor height is correct
* Sidebar "New File"/"New Folder" creates inside the selected folder instead of at root
* Reveal in File Manager works on macOS and Windows (not just Linux)
* Opening an already-open script activates its tab instead of closing it

## [0.2.0] – 2026-01-30
