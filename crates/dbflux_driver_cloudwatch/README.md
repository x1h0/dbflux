# dbflux_driver_cloudwatch

AWS CloudWatch Logs driver for DBFlux, built on the [`aws-sdk-cloudwatchlogs`](https://crates.io/crates/aws-sdk-cloudwatchlogs) SDK.

## Features

- Log-streaming driver classified as `DatabaseCategory::LogStream`; `deployment_class` is `CloudManaged`. The declared capabilities are `AUTHENTICATION` and `METRIC_SERIES`.
- AWS connection configuration via region, named profile, and optional endpoint override, aligned with the DynamoDB AWS connection flow.
- Query execution through `StartQuery` + polling `GetQueryResults` (poll interval 500 ms, up to 120 attempts), with an editor-managed source context that supplies the target log groups and time range.
- Three query syntaxes selectable from the source-context "Syntax" dropdown:
  - CloudWatch Logs Insights QL (`cwli`, the default) — `QueryLanguage::CloudWatchLogsInsightsQl`.
  - OpenSearch PPL (`ppl`) — `QueryLanguage::OpenSearchPpl`.
  - OpenSearch SQL (`sql`) — `QueryLanguage::OpenSearchSql`.
  These map to the SDK's `Cwli`, `Ppl`, and `Sql` query-language values.
- Source-context spec (`SourceContextSpec`) exposes a "Log groups" target selector and Start/End time-range controls; CWLI and PPL queries pass the selected log groups to `StartQuery` via `set_log_group_names`.
- Schema discovery enumerates log groups (`fetch_log_groups`) as the single logical database (`SchemaLoadingStrategy::SingleDatabase`, default database `logs`).
- Log streams are surfaced as paginated collection children (`collection_children` over `fetch_log_stream_page`) and open as event streams (`CollectionPresentation::EventStream`).
- Event-stream browsing (`browse_event_stream` / `EventStreamTarget`) backed by `FilterLogEvents`, with a default 24-hour browse window and support for filter pattern, stream-name prefix, explicit stream names, and a most-recent toggle.
- Insights column names are classified into semantic `ColumnKind`s (e.g. `@timestamp`, `@ingestionTime` recognized as timestamps) for chart auto-detection.
- CloudWatch Metrics via `GetMetricData`: executes a single `MetricDataQuery` per request, maps the response to a two-column (timestamp, value) `QueryResult` ordered ascending by timestamp. Timestamps from AWS (second-precision) are converted to milliseconds. Multi-metric pivot to wide format is supported when multiple `MetricDataResult` entries are returned.
- Browse CloudWatch metric catalog (namespaces and per-namespace metrics with dimension combinations) via `ListMetrics` pagination. Namespace listing is synthesized by sweeping `ListMetrics` with no filter and collecting distinct namespace strings. Results are cached in-session by `MetricCatalogCache`.
- Metric catalog is browsable from the connection sidebar tree (Metrics > Namespace > Metric). Clicking a metric leaf opens a chart pre-populated with defaults (Average / 5 min period / aggregate across all dimensions) and immediately executes it. The picker rail in the chart document allows refining dimensions, period, and statistic.

## Limitations

- The `profile` field (AWS named profile) is an `AuthProfileRef` form field. The generic portability seam (`DbDriver::export_field_hint`) maps all `AuthProfileRef` fields to `RequiredOnImport`, so the field value is omitted from any exported bundle and recipients must supply or create a matching auth profile at import time. No driver-specific override is required.
- Query cancellation is not implemented; `cancel()` returns `NotSupported`.
- OpenSearch SQL mode does not receive external log groups: SQL queries must declare their queried log groups in the SQL text, because the CloudWatch API does not accept external log-group parameters for SQL mode (only CWLI and PPL get `set_log_group_names`).
- Editor syntax highlighting remains generic (`query_language` is reported as `Sql` at the metadata level); mode selection drives execution semantics and completion keywords rather than per-mode highlighting.
- Read-only: no mutation, DDL, transaction, or pagination capabilities are declared (`query`, `mutation`, `ddl`, `transactions`, `limits` are all `None`); `schema_features` is empty.
- No SSL form (TLS handled by the AWS SDK transport).
- Metrics execution supports a single `MetricDataQuery` per request per call.
- The namespace list synthesis (sweeping `ListMetrics` with no filter) can be slow for large AWS accounts with many metrics; it is cached for the session once complete. The sweep is capped at 50 pages (~25,000 metrics) to bound the worst case on very large accounts. When the cap is hit, the namespace list is truncated silently and a warning is logged; a future change will replace the cap with full timeout + cancellation infrastructure.
- Live integration tests for metrics (`live_execute_cloudwatch_metric`) require real AWS credentials and are `#[ignore]`d by default. LocalStack Community does not support the CloudWatch Metrics API.
