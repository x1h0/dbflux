//! `DashboardDocument` — a named collection of `ChartDocument` panels with a
//! shared time range and refresh policy.
//!
//! Each panel slot can be either a live `ChartDocument` entity (`Loaded`) or a
//! placeholder for a deleted chart (`Orphan`). The shared `TimeRangePanel`
//! propagates window changes to every loaded panel via subscriptions. Panel
//! re-execution is bounded by `PANEL_REEXEC_CAP` to avoid overwhelming the
//! connection with concurrent queries.
