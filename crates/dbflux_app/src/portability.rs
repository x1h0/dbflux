//! Connection-export/import bridge between `dbflux_portability` and `AppState`.
//!
//! This module owns the two seam implementations that the portability crate
//! requires from the app layer — `FieldHintResolver` and `SecretReader` — the
//! function that assembles an `ExportGraph` from AppState data, and the
//! `apply_import` orchestration that persists `ImportActions` through the
//! existing repositories and keyring.
//!
//! # Testability contract
//!
//! All public items in this module depend only on plain data or on trait objects
//! that can be satisfied by fakes in unit tests.  No GPUI `Entity` or `Context`
//! types appear here, which is what allows the `dbflux_app` test binary to
//! compile and run these tests (unlike `dbflux_ui_windows`, whose GPUI proc-macro
//! expansion causes rustc to SIGSEGV during test-binary compilation).
//!
//! # Import persistence invariants
//!
//! `apply_import` persists `ImportActions` with ordered best-effort writes and
//! NO DB+keyring two-phase commit (2PC).  The insertion order is:
//!
//! 1. Auth profiles (so later connection foreign-key-like references exist)
//! 2. SSH tunnel profiles
//! 3. Proxy profiles
//! 4. Connections (referencing all of the above)
//! 5. Secret writes via `SecretManager::set_by_ref`
//!
//! A `false` return from `set_by_ref` (keyring locked or unavailable) is
//! captured in `ImportOutcome::secret_failures` — it is NEVER silently
//! discarded.  Connections whose `driver_id` is unregistered are recorded in
//! `ImportOutcome::needs_driver` and NOT persisted with a placeholder config.
